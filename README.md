# **&mdash;** Hello!  
My name is Nazarii and this here is website-resume for [Ryu Hoshi](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004808958030).  
Here is the list what is **implemented**:  
1. It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
2. All tasks and issues are described in details
3. <code>&#60;head&#62;</code> tags are properly used. Thanks to [HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for an excellent reference
4. HTML markup is valid. Checked with [W3C Markup Validator Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
5. [GitFlow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) is used during the project. There are a bunch of branches(they should have been deleted probably, but anyway, I'll keep them for reference)
6. Animated GIF is added. Hope, it would make Ryu happy:smiley:
7. The service worker is configured locally using pre-commit git hook
8. Hopefully, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc1=h_ls) will confirm my registration in less than 24 hours, and I'll be able to set up a basic CI/CD(If you reading it, it didn't happen)

Thank you for a great lecture:heart_eyes:
