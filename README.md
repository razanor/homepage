# **&mdash;** Hello!  
My name is Nazarii and this here is website-resume for [Ryu Hoshi](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004808958030).  
Here is the list what is **implemented**:  
1. It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
2. All tasks and issues are described in details
3. <code>&#60;head&#62;</code> tags are properly used. Thanks to [HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for an excellent reference
4. HTML markup is valid. Checked with [W3C Markup Validator Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
5. [GitFlow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) is used during the project. There are a bunch of branches(they should have been deleted probably, but anyway, I'll keep them for reference)
6. Animated GIF is added. Hope, it would make Ryu happy:smiley:
7. The service worker is configured locally using pre-commit git hook
8. Webhook is added by setting up a basic CI/CD process using Travis CI and AWS. Check out the [link](http://razanor.com-production.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) here!
